NAME
    OLE::Storage_Lite - Read and Write OLE files on any platform

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to read and write an OLE-Structured file.
    It works anywhere Raku works, without the need of an OLE binary.

REQUIREMENT
    Raku 6.c (anything that supports experimental:pack)

INSTALLATION
    Using the Zef installer:

        zef update
        zef install OLE::Storage_Lite

SAMPLE
    This still retains the Perl 5 sample scripts, will rewrite these for
    proper Raku compatibility later.

    smplls.pl : displays PPS structure of specified file
                (subset of "lls" distributed with OLE::Storage)

    smpsv.pl  : creates and save a sample OLE-file(tsv.dat).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This module is as close to a 1:1 translation of the Perl 5 OLE::Storage_Lite
    module as I could reasonably get. All glory belongs to Kawai Takanori, all
    new bugs are my fault.
